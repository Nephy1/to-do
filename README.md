# A To-Do List I'm creating for practice

- Followed a YouTube video
- Unfinished , Need to figure out how to save tasks so they don't wipe on refresh/closure.

## Thing's I learned
- Having the gradient effect on text was a cool addition. I always wondered how to do it and now I have some code to reference for that.
- Also little things like opacity on hover and active add a nice touch to UX.
